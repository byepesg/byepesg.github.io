            <h3>Research at Purdue University</h3>
            <p>During a 9-month internship at Purdue University, I worked on designing and analyzing Differential Privacy Compress Then Encrypt (DPCTE) schemes. This involved creating mechanisms that combine data compression and encryption with privacy guarantees, contributing to a submission for the STOC conference under the guidance of Dr. Jeremiah M. Blocki and Dr. Seunghoon Lee.</p>
